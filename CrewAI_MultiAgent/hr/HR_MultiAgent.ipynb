    "### Agents\n",
    "1. **HR Intent Classification Agent** — Categorizes query (leave/payroll/benefits/transfer/conduct/general) with confidence.\n",
    "2. **HR Policy Reasoning Agent** — Uses static HR_POLICIES to pick applicable policy areas and allowed actions.\n",
    "3. **HR Response Drafting Agent** — Produces a safe response following allowed actions; avoids collecting sensitive info.\n",
    "4. **HR Escalation Decision Agent** — Decides escalation based on sensitivity, security, low confidence, or policy triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Flow / Handoffs\n",
    "Sequential: **Intent → Policy → Response → Escalation**. Downstream agents explicitly consume upstream outputs.\n",

    "### Escalation Logic\n",
    "- LLM‑based escalation agent decision + **deterministic risk safeguard** (keywords, category, confidence).\n",
    "- Automatically escalates for conduct/grievance and identity/security flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Rationale\n",
    "- Non‑RAG compliance: policies are static context; no external retrieval.\n",
    "- Strict JSON: simplifies orchestration and grading reproducibility.\n",
    "- Safety: avoids collecting secrets and escalates sensitive HR cases.\n"
